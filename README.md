# discord-bot-template

Really simple bot template that is heavily based off of the [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide). I use this template in most of my Discord bots and thought it'd be handy to share out.

## Building / Running

1. `make`
1. `cp example.env [prod | test | dev].env`, fill out file
1. `./scripts/start.sh [prod | test | dev]`
